If you haven't, I typically follow [Kenneth Reitz's installation guides](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/#installation-guides) for Mac and Linux and [Anthony DeBarros's guide](http://www.anthonydebarros.com/2015/08/16/setting-up-python-in-windows-10/) for Windows users. The [pipenv installation instructions](https://docs.pipenv.org/#install-pipenv-today) are pretty straightforward. ([Hit me up](mailto:cody@ire.org) if you run into problems!)\n",
