# #IRE18: Working with data in Python for beginners
Code and documentation for ["Working with data in Python for beginners,"](https://www.ire.org/events-and-training/event/3190/3784/) a 3-hour class at [IRE 2018 in Orlando, Florida](https://ire.org/conferences/ire-2018/).

- **When:** Friday, June 15 at 9 a.m.

- **Where:** TK

- **What:** This class will introduce you to the Python programming language as it is used to analyze data in the newsroom. We'll cover basic syntax and programming concepts; newsroom use cases and examples; and analyze data using a library called [`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org). We'll also talk about how to get up and running with Python on your own machine so you can take it all home.

- **Teachers:** Me and [Matt Wynn](https://github.com/mattwynn1).

- **Prerequisites:** You should be comfortable working with data in spreadsheets or SQL or whatever. No programming experience required.

## Afterward

[Here's a quick guide](reference/Starting%20a%20new%20Python%20project%20from%20scratch.ipynb) to starting a new data analysis project on _your_ computer.

If you run into trouble, ask for help! (ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ _Keep reading_ ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡)

### Don't get discouraged!

As you learn to code, you will get stuck. Many times. Don't get discouraged! 

**Learn to love error messages.** They can be scary at first, but error messages will show you what went wrong, on what line, with clues about how to fix it. If you're not sure what an error means, start by Googling it.

**Find a newsroom project that Python can help you solve (rather than setting out to "learn Python").** Python is a tool that you can use to accomplish some goal. Don't feel like you have to be a master before you can start writing scripts -- find a project and get cracking.

**Break the problem into manageable chunks.** Take things one step at a time. Don't think about everything you need to do in order to get an Slack alert whenever a batch of new campaign finance data is posted that includes the governor's family. Think about what you need to do to fetch the page. Write that code, one step at a time, and run it to make sure it works. Then think about what you need to do to parse the HTML. Then worry about writing a function to hit Slack. That way you'll catch errors quicker and you'll be able to see more clearly where problems are being introduced.

Sketching out your ideas on paper, in _pseudocode_, can be a good way to break things down. In other words, write out the things you want to accomplish informally, not worrying about syntax -- just get the ideas down on paper. Then come back and translate what you have into working code.

**Ask for help.** You have many friends in journalism who want to help you succeed. Here are just a handful of places where you can post Python questions and get help:

- [NICAR-L](https://www.ire.org/resource-center/listservs/subscribe-nicar-l/)
- [Newsnerdery Slack](http://newsnerdery.org/) (check the #python channel)
- [Lonely Coder's Club Slack](https://lcc-slack.herokuapp.com/)
- [PythonJournos](https://github.com/PythonJournos/LearningPython/wiki)

**... but Google your problem first.** It is _highly unlikely_ that you are the first person in history to encounter your problem. If you have an error message, Google it. If you are trying to remember "how to open a csv file in python," Google it. The ProPublica nerds have a [great post](https://www.propublica.org/nerds/item/how-to-ask-programming-questions) on question-asking strategies.

A typical development cycle: Write some code. Run it. See what errors break your script. Throw in some strategically placed `print()` statements. Check the documentation. Google around. Fix your errors. Encounter new and different errors! Rinse and repeat.

**Find a coding buddy or mentor, or both.** It's nice to have somebody who's learning alongside you, and it's _extra_ nice to have a mentor who's willing to help you through the baby steps.

**Keep learning.** Like any other technical skill, programming is a use-it-or-lose-it deal. Some links to check out:
